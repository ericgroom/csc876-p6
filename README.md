# frontend-framework-evaluation CSC 876 p6

This was created as a part of CSC 876 (Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems) at SFSU. 
It is an evaluation of the three major frontend javascript frameworks React, Angular and Vue using the LSP method created by Jozo DujmoviÄ‡.

For the evaluation, I created various small applications in all three frameworks and compared them to create an evaluation model. This code and the accompanying [writeup](report.pdf) are in the repo.
